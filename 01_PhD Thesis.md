My thesis argues that belief is subject to a truth norm that states that one ought to believe something if and only if it’s true. I argue for this on the grounds that it can explain epistemic justification. The truth norm explains justification because the means one should take in order to conform to this norm would just involve, I claim, having beliefs that we pre-theoretically take to be justified. And the fact that it can explain justification in this way is, I argue, sufficient reason to think that belief is subject to such a truth norm.

After introducing the truth norm account of justification in Chapter One, the argument of my thesis involves two main stages. Part One of the thesis (Ch. 2-3) contains the first stage, in which I argue that my way of arguing for the truth norm, on the basis of its explanatory role in *epistemology*, is much more likely to be successful than a more popular way of arguing for the truth norm, on the basis of its explanatory role in *the philosophy of mind*. Part Two (Ch. 4-7) contains the second stage, in which I argue that the truth norm can indeed explain justification in the way I’ve outlined.

### Part One: How and How Not to Argue for the Truth Norm

In Chapter Two, I discuss various attempts to argue that belief is subject to a truth norm on the basis of the explanatory role of such a norm in the philosophy of mind. Such attempts typically argue that we need to think of the attitude of belief as *constitutively* subject to a truth norm in order to explain some psychological feature of belief. It has been suggested that belief being subject to the truth norm can explain, for example, what distinguishes belief from other attitudes, the transparency of doxastic deliberation, the normativity of mental content, the impossibility of believing at will, and Moore’s paradox. These attempts are unconvincing, I argue, because *either* these features can be explained by much weaker claims than the truth norm, *or* the truth norm can only explain these features given very strong theoretical assumptions.

I conclude that we should not try to give *independent* reason for thinking belief is subject to a truth norm, a norm which we *then* go on to use to explain justification. We should instead, I argue, think of belief as subject to a truth norm *because* that can do justice to our pre-theoretical understanding of justification, much as one might argue for a moral norm or theory because it does justice to our pre-theoretical understanding of what we ought to do. The best argument for the truth norm is not one that appeals to philosophy of mind, but one within epistemology.

Chapter Three goes into detail about one key feature of our pre-theoretical understanding of justification that the truth norm can explain. I argue that the truth norm can explain the *unity* of justification, i.e. what unifies justified beliefs that in other respects look heterogeneous. In particular, the truth norm can explain, I argue, a) what unifies radically different *methods* that lead to justified beliefs (e.g. what explains why both, say, mental arithmetic and testimony can lead to justified beliefs), and b) what unifies the radically different *properties* of a hypothesis that bear on whether one is justified in believing it (e.g. how conservative, modest, or simple the hypothesis is).

### Part Two: How the Truth Norm Explains Justification

In Part Two, I argue that the truth norm can explain justification, by answering four criticisms of the truth norm. Responding to these criticisms involves modifying and amending the basic truth norm account in a few different ways. But once modified, the truth norm can succeed in explaining justification. In this way, it is through answering these criticisms that we can see the contours of a defensible explanation of justification in terms of the truth norm.

Chapter Four answers philosophers who object to the fact that truth norm prescribes believing all the truths. The way most proponents of the truth norm respond to this problem is to modify the truth norm so that it doesn’t involve this implausible prescription. I argue that a number of popular ways of modifying the truth norm fail. These include making the truth norm a purely *negative* duty to *avoid believing falsehoods*, and claiming that the truth norm *only* applies in relation to propositions one is *consciously considering*. These modified truth norms fail, I argue, because they have implausible consequences that make them incapable of explaining justification. There is, however, one modified version of the truth norm that I’ll defend, which avoids the problems associated with a prescription to believe all the truths, but doesn’t thereby fail to explain justification. This norm, introduced (but not defended) by Conor McHugh, states that *if* one has some *doxastic attitude* about p, then one ought to believe that p if and only if p is true. 

Chapter Five discusses a related problem with suspension of judgement. Some have argued that a truth norm has a problem dealing with suspension of judgement, since suspending judgement about whether p *guarantees* it that one won’t conform to the truth norm with regards to p. This problem, I claim, essentially leads to a related problem about how the truth norm can explain why one is justified in believing that p only if one has above a certain *threshold* of evidence that counts as sufficient. In order to explain this, I argue, we need to add an extra requirement on belief into our explanation, a requirement that *if* one fails to conform to the truth norm, one does so by suspending judgement rather than by believing falsely, i.e. a requirement to *err on the side of caution*.

Chapter Six discusses an argument against the truth norm account given by Katrin Glüer and Åsa Wikforss, which is known as ‘the no guidance argument’. This argument claims that that we should reject the truth norm because it cannot guide belief formation, because in order to follow it one has to determine whether p is true, which amounts to forming a belief about p. This makes the guidance seem to come ‘too late’. I argue that this argument fails. Firstly, drawing on a response given by Asbjørn Steglich-Petersen, I argue that it relies on an overly restrictive conception of what it is for a norm to provide guidance. We should, I argue, prefer a more inclusive conception of guidance. Secondly, given the central role of the truth norm is to explain why one should follow *other* norms, the truth norm does not need to actively provide guidance in a believer’s consciousness play this explanatory role.

Chapter Seven shows how the truth norm account can deal with supposedly problematic examples in which having a prima facie unjustified belief is a means to the end of having many other true beliefs, i.e. cases in one can make a ‘sacrifice for the greater epistemic good’. The vast majority of these examples are unproblematic, I argue, because on the truth norm account, justification is *proposition-relative*, i.e. a belief *that p* is justified if and only if having that belief is a good means the end of having *a true belief that p*. Although this explains why the majority of sacrifices for the greater epistemic good do not count as justified, there is still a remaining class of problem cases. These are self-fulfilling beliefs - beliefs that cause their own truth - such as a belief that people like me, which makes me more sociable, which causes people to like me. In order to explain why self-fulfilling beliefs are unjustified, I argue that we need to further amend the truth norm account by adding a further *causal independence* condition on justification, i.e. to claim that a belief that p is not justified if it causally dependent on the fact that I believe that p.
