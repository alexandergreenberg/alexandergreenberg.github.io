My thesis argues that belief is subject to a truth norm that states that one ought to believe that p if and only if p is true. I argue for this on the grounds that it can explain epistemic justification. The truth norm explains justification because the means one should take in order to conform to this norm would just involve, I claim, having beliefs that we pre-theoretically take to be justified. And the fact that it can explain justification in this way, I argue, is sufficient reason to think that belief is subject to such a truth norm.

After introducing the truth norm account of justification in Chapter One, the argument of my thesis involves two main stages. Part One of the thesis (Ch. 2-3) contains the first stage, in which I argue that my way of arguing for the truth norm, on the basis of its explanatory role in *epistemology*, is much more likely to be successful than a more popular way of arguing for the truth norm, on the basis of its explanatory role in *the philosophy of mind*. Part Two (Ch. 4-7) contains the second stage, in which I argue that the truth norm can indeed explain justification in the way I’ve outlined.

### Part One: How and How Not to Argue for the Truth Norm

In Chapter Two, I discuss various attempts to argue that belief is subject to a truth norm on the basis of the explanatory role of such a norm in the philosophy of mind. Such attempts typically attempt to argue that we need to think of the attitude of belief as *constitutively* subject to a truth norm in order to explain some psychological feature of belief. It has been suggested that belief being subject to the truth norm can explain, for example, what distinguishes belief from other attitudes, the transparency of doxastic deliberation, and Moore’s paradox. These attempts are unconvincing, I argue, because *either* these features can be explained by much weaker claims than the truth norm, *or* the truth norm can only explain these features given very strong theoretical assumptions.

I conclude that we should not to try to give *independent* reason for thinking belief is subject to a truth norm, a norm which we *then* go on to use to explain justification. We should instead, I argue, think of belief as subject to a truth norm *because* that can do justice to our pre-theoretical understanding of justification, much as one might argue for a moral norm or theory because it does justice to our pre-theoretical understanding of what we ought to do. The best argument for the truth norm in this way is not one that appeals to philosophy of mind, but one within epistemology.

Chapter Three goes into detail about one key feature of our pre-theoretical understanding of justification that the truth norm can explain. I argue that the truth norm can explain the *unity* of justification, i.e. what unifies justified beliefs that in other respects look heterogeneous. In particular, the truth norm can explain, I argue, a) what unifies radically different *methods* that lead to justified beliefs (e.g. what explains why both, say, mental arithmetic and testimony can lead to justified beliefs), and b) what unifies the radically different *properties* of a hypothesis that bear on whether one is justified in believing it (e.g. how conservative, modest, or simple the hypothesis is).

### Part Two: How the Truth Norm Explains Justification

In Part Two, I argue that the truth norm can explain justification, by answering four criticisms of the truth norm. It is through answering these criticisms that we can see the contours of a defensible explanation of justification in terms of the truth norm.

Chapter Four answers philosophers who object to the fact that truth norm prescribes believing all the truths. This criticism fails, I argue once one recognises the way in which the truth norm is supposed to explain justification. Taking the means one should take in order to conform with the truth norm would not, I argue, involve believing all the truths; in fact, it would involve suspending judgement about the vast majority of truths.

Chapter Five discusses a related problem with suspension of judgement. Some have argued that a truth norm has a problem dealing with suspension of judgement, since suspending judgement about whether p *guarantees* it that one won’t conform to the truth norm with regards to p. Appealing to the same kind of considerations as those in the previous chapter can go some way towards dealing with this problem. However, there still is a problem left over, which is the problem of how the truth norm can explain why one is justified in believing that p only if one has above a certain *threshold* of evidence that counts as sufficient. In order to explain this, I argue, we need to add an extra requirement on belief into our explanation, a requirement that *if* one fails to conform to the truth norm, one does so by suspending judgement rather than by believing falsely, i.e. a requirement to err on the side of caution.

Chapter Six shows how the truth norm account can deal with supposedly problematic examples in which having a prima facie unjustified belief is a means to the end of having many other true beliefs. These examples are unproblematic, I argue, because on the truth norm account, justification is *proposition-relative*, i.e. a belief *that p* is justified if and only if having that belief is a good means the end of having *a true belief that p*.

Chapter Seven discusses a criticism that claims that having justified beliefs is only *contingently* a means to conforming to the truth norm, and therefore cannot be the means one should take in order to conform to the truth norm. This is unproblematic, I argue, once we get clear on the sense of ‘means’ the truth norm account should appeal to. The means of conforming to the truth norm that result in having justified beliefs are *not*, I argue, whatever means that actually lead to one believing truly. Rather, the means of conforming to the truth norm that result in having justified beliefs are *only* those means which a subject is *in a position to discern* that they will lead to believing truly. this is right, a defensible version of the truth norm account must include a modicum of epistemic internalism.
