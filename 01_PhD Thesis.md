I argue that belief is subject to a truth norm that states that one ought to believe that p if and only if p is true. I argue for this on the grounds that belief being subject to such a norm can explain epistemic justification. The norm explains justification because the means one should take in order to conform to this norm would just involve, I claim, having beliefs that we pre-theoretically take to be justified. Part One introduces this account (Ch. 1), and discusses different ways of arguing for it (Ch. 2-3). Chapter Two discusses and rejects attempts to argue that it is constitutive of the attitude of belief to be subject to such a norm. I conclude that we should not try to give independent reason for thinking belief is subject to a truth norm, which we then go on to use to explain justification. We should instead, I argue, think of belief as subject to a truth norm because that can do justice to our pre-theoretical understanding of justification. Chapter Three goes into detail about one key feature of our pre-theoretical understanding of justification that the truth norm can explain, the unity of justification, i.e. the truth norm can explain what unifies justified beliefs that in other respects look heterogeneous.

Part Two (Ch. 4-6) responds to criticisms of the truth norm account. In Chapter Four, I argue against the claim that truth norm gives problematic prescriptions, i.e. that it prescribes believing all the truths, that it prescribes believing true propositions of the form ‘p, but I don’t believe that p’, and that it never prescribes suspending judgement. These criticisms fail because the means one should take to conform to the truth norm will never, I argue, involve carrying out these problematic prescriptions. Chapter Five shows how the truth norm account can deal with supposedly problematic examples in which having a prima facie unjustified belief is a means to the end of having many other true beliefs. These examples are unproblematic, I argue, because on the truth norm account, justification is proposition-relative, i.e. a belief that p is justified if and only if having that belief is a good means the end of having a true belief that p. Chapter Six discusses a criticism that claims that having justified beliefs is only contingently a means to conforming to the truth norm, and therefore cannot be the means one should take in order to conform to the truth norm. This is unproblematic, I argue, once we get clear on the sense of ‘means’ the truth norm account should appeal to. My general conclusion, therefore, is that the criticisms of the truth norm can be dissolved once we fully recognise the way in which the truth norm is supposed to explain justification.
