title: Criminal Law and the Mind Seminar
permalink: /seminar/
---

Its focus will on the various psychological concepts that both have been discussed by philosophers and play a role in the criminal law, such as knowledge, belief, awareness, consciousness, intention, action, attempt, reason, and emotion. The aim of the seminar is to bring together legal and philosophical perspectives on these psychological concepts and to see how legal theory and philosophy can mutually inform one another.



The seminars will take place **Thursdays at 17:00-18:30 BST** on Zoom. If you'd like to attend, [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with 'Criminal Law and the Mind registration' in the subject line, and I'll add you to the mailing list for the seminars.
