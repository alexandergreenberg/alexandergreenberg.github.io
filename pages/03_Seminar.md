# *Criminal Law and the Mind* Seminar

As part of my Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship project, *Belief in Philosophy and the Criminal Law*, I am running a visiting speaker seminar series in the UCL Philosophy Department in 2020-21. It will focus on various psychological concepts that both have been discussed by philosophers and play a role in the criminal law, such as knowledge, belief, awareness, consciousness, intention, action, attempt, reason, and emotion. It will bring together legal and philosophical perspectives on these concepts and see how legal theory and philosophy can mutually inform one another.

Some of the seminars will be pre-read and some will be presentations. Each seminar will feature comments from a UCL respondent followed by a Q&A.

The seminars will take place **Thursdays at 17:00-18:30 UK time** on Zoom. If you'd like to attend, [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with 'Criminal Law and the Mind registration' in the subject line, and I'll add you to the mailing list for the seminars. In advance of each seminar you'll receive a Zoom link and the paper for the pre-read sessions.
