    <h4>"Is the Norm on Belief Evaluative? A Response to McHugh" (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/christophercowiephilosophy2/" target="_blank">Christopher Cowie</a>), <em>Pacific Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 2016. (<a href="/pdfs/is-the-norm-on-belief-evaluative.pdf" target="_blank">penultimate draft</a>) (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papq.12158/abstract" target="_blank">published version</a>)</a></h4>

    <div id="para1" class="hidden"><p>We respond to Conor McHugh's claim that an evaluative account of the normative relation between belief and truth is preferable to a prescriptive account. We claim that his arguments fail to establish this. We then draw a more general sceptical conclusion: we take our arguments to put pressure on any attempt to show that an evaluative account will fare better than a prescriptive account.</p></div> <!-- The class hidden was adden to start with the abstracts hidden. -->

    <h4>"Epistemic Trade-Offs"</h4>
    <p><a href="javascript:;" onclick="return toggleMe('para2')" value="Toggle"><strong>Abstract</strong></a></p>
    <div id="para2" class="hidden"><p>It is often claimed that true belief is the fundamental goal of epistemic justification. Call this claim ‘veritism’. Particular examples are alleged to create problems for this claim: examples in which having a belief that looks prima facie unjustified is a means to the end of having a large number of other true beliefs. In a series of recent articles, Selim Berker has argued that these examples should lead us to reject veritism <em>tout court</em>. This conclusion, I’ll argue, is unwarranted. A plausible version of veritism has no problem dealing with these cases.</p></div>

    <h4>"The Believing-All-The-Truths Problem"</h4>
    <p><a href="javascript:;" onclick="return toggleMe('para3')" value="Toggle"><strong>Abstract</strong></a></p>
    <div id="para3" class="hidden"><p>Should I believe something if and only if it’s true? Many philosophers have objected to this kind of truth norm, on the grounds that it’s not the case that one ought to believe all the truths. Philosophers who want to defend the claim that belief is subject to a truth norm often respond to this problem by reformulating a truth norm in ways that do not entail that one ought to believe all the truths. Many of these attempts at reformulation, I argue, have been missteps. A number of these different reformulations are incapable of carrying out a central role a truth norm is meant to play, that of explaining justification. The truth norm I defend, however, avoids the problems associated with a prescription to believe all the truths, but doesn’t thereby fail to explain justification. This norm, introduced (but not defended) by Conor McHugh, states that if one has some doxastic attitude about p – i.e. if one believes, disbelieves, or suspends judgement about whether p – then one ought to believe that p if and only if p is true.</p></div>

    <h4>"Truth Norms, Belief, and Guidance"</h4>
    <p><a href="javascript:;" onclick="return toggleMe('para4')" value="Toggle"><strong>Abstract</strong></a></p>
    <div id="para4" class="hidden"><p>In this paper, I defend the claim that belief is subject to a truth norm against ‘the no guidance argument’, given by Katrin Glüer and Åsa Wikforss, which claims we should reject a truth norm because it cannot guide belief formation. I argue that this argument fails. Drawing on a response given by Asbjørn Steglich-Petersen, I argue that Glüer and Wikforss rely on an overly restrictive conception of what it is for a norm to provide guidance. We should, I argue, prefer a more inclusive conception of guidance Steglich-Petersen puts forward, which allows a truth norm to guide. In the end, however, a truth norm guiding directly is not central to the way a truth norm is supposed to explain epistemic justification.</p></div>

    <h4>"Truth Norms and Suspension of Judgement"</h4>
    <p><a href="javascript:;" onclick="return toggleMe('para5')" value="Toggle"><strong>Abstract</strong></a></p>
    <div id="para5" class="hidden"><p>A truth norm has a particular difficulty explaining when and why one ought to suspend judgement. For a truth norm to succeed in explaining justification, the subsidiary norms which one should follow as a means of conforming to that norm need to prescribe suspending judgement in many cases. However, given that one can only succeed in conforming to a truth norm by having a true belief, it’s difficult to explain why the means of conforming to a truth norm would ever involve suspending judgement. This problem has not been fully appreciated by defenders of truth norms, and the main answers so far given, I suggest, are inadequate. However, a truth norm can in the end explain when and why one ought to suspend judgement, but in order to do so we need to think that there is another fundamental epistemic norm in addition to whatever particular truth norm we opt for. This additional fundamental epistemic norm is one that states that if one fails to conform to this truth norm, one should not do so by having a false belief. In other words, we need to think that there is a contrary-to-duty obligation to err on the side of caution.</p></div>

    <h4>"Respresentation and Mispresentation" (with <a href="https://oxford.academia.edu/LucyCampbell" target="_blank">Lucy Campbell</a>)</h4>
    <p><a href="javascript:;" onclick="return toggleMe('para6')" value="Toggle"><strong>Abstract</strong></a></p>
    <div id="para6" class="hidden"><p>It is often said that there is no representation without the possibility of misrepresentation, and the slogan has important philosophical implications in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophical logic. But on the face of it the slogan is subject to counterexamples. Both knowledge and necessarily true beliefs might seem to be representations which cannot misrepresent. We reject both counterexamples. Rejecting the second requires distinguishing a stronger and a weaker reading of the slogan. The case of necessarily true beliefs is, we grant, a counterexample to the stronger reading of the slogan, but it is not a counterexample to the weaker reading. Furthermore, the weaker reading can do all the theoretical work one might need it to.</p></div>

    <h4>"There is No 'Norm of Assertion'"</h4>
    <p><a href="javascript:;" onclick="return toggleMe('para7')" value="Toggle"><strong>Abstract</strong></a></p>
    <div id="para7" class="hidden"><p>There are norms on action and norms on assertion. That is to say, there are some things we should and shouldn’t do, and there are some things we should and shouldn’t say. In this paper, I’ll be concerned with the relations between these two kinds of norm. In particular, I’ll be considering whether or not norms on assertion are reducible to norms on action. Many philosophers think that norms on assertion are not reducible to norms on action. These philosophers think that there is a sui generis norm that is specific to assertion. I argue against this view. The phenomenon that is claimed to support it – the intuitive wrongness of certain assertions in certain contexts – does not in fact support it. Given that assertion is an action, the wrongness of these assertions can be explained purely in virtue of norms on action. And the specifically epistemic wrongness that an assertion norm is typically supposed to explain can be explained by the norm that one shouldn’t act on epistemically faulty beliefs. No additional sui generis norm on assertion is needed.</p></div>
