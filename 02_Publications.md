<p id="para1">
<div class="hidden"><p id="para1">We respond to Conor McHugh's claim that an evaluative account of the normative relation between belief and truth is preferable to a prescriptive account. We claim that his arguments fail to establish this. We then draw a more general sceptical conclusion: we take our arguments to put pressure on any attempt to show that an evaluative account will fare better than a prescriptive account.

#### "Sacrifices for the greater epistemic good?" (under review).

**Abstract**: It is often claimed that true belief is the fundamental goal of epistemic justification. Call this claim ‘veritism’. Particular examples are alleged to create problems for this claim: examples in which having a belief that looks prima facie unjustified is a means to the end of having a large number of other true beliefs. In a series of recent articles, Selim Berker has argued that these examples should lead us to reject veritism *tout court*. This conclusion, I’ll argue, is unwarranted. These examples pose no problem for a *proposition-relative* version of veritism, which claims that a belief *that p* is justified only if having that belief is a good means to having *a true belief that p*.

#### "Should I believe all the truths?"

**Abstract**: Should I believe that p if and only if p is true? Many have argued against this kind of truth norm on the grounds that it’s not the case that I ought to believe all the truths. Most philosophers who want to defend the claim that belief is subject to a truth norm respond to this criticism by reformulating the truth norm in ways that do not entail that one ought to believe all the truths. This, I argue, has been a misstep. The different reformulations of this norm are incapable of carrying out a central role a truth norm is meant to play, that of explaining justification. Fortunately for proponents of the truth norm approach, the truth norm does not need to be reformulated. Once we recognise the role of the truth norm in explaining justification, the fact that it prescribes believing all the truths is unproblematic.
