#### "Is the Norm on Belief Evaluative? A Response to McHugh" (with Christopher Cowie), forthcoming in *Pacific Philosophical Quarterly*.

In this paper, Chris Cowie and I respond to Conor McHugh's claim that an evaluative account of the normative relation between belief and truth is preferable to a prescriptive account. We claim that his arguments fail to establish this. We then draw a more general sceptical conclusion: we take our arguments to put pressure on any attempt to show that an evaluative account will fare better than a prescriptive account.
