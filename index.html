    <p class="paragraph">I am a philosopher. I work on the intersection of philosophy of mind, epistemology, and ethics.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I'm currently a temporary lecturer in philosophy at the University of Southampton. I was previously a lecturer at at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, and at Birkbeck, University of London. I've also been a Visiting Fellow on the <a href="https://representationandreality.gu.se" target="_blank">Representation and Reality</a> project at the University of Gothenburg, and a member of the <a href="http://www.newdirectionsproject.com" target="_blank">New Directions in the Study of the Mind</a> project at the University of Cambridge, where I also studied for my PhD.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">My research centres on psychological, epistemological, and normative questions about belief, such as:</p>
      <ul class="questions-list">
        <li>What is it to believe something?</li>
        <li>What should we believe?</li>
        <li>In what sense can we be held responsible for what we believe?</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">My <a href="/phd-thesis/">PhD thesis</a> was on epistemic normativity. In particular, it argued that belief is subject to a truth norm that prescribes that one ought to believe something if and only if it's true. It argued for this on the grounds that belief being subject to such a norm can give a unifying explanation of epistemic justification. My supervisors were <a href="http://www.timcrane.com" target="_blank">Tim Crane</a> and <a href="http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/ahmed/ahmed-page" target="_blank">Arif Ahmed</a>.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Currently, I am working on a variety of issues in epistemology, moral psychology, and the history of philosophy of mind. These include:
      <ul class="questions-list">
        <li>Thinking about whether there are distinctively epistemic norms on speech acts like assertion.</li>
        <li>Investigating responsibility for belief by looking at how lawyers and legal theorists think about the legal categories of <em>mens rea</em> (intention, foreknowledge, recklessness, negligence).</li>
        <li>For my work on the Representation and Reality project, looking at how Aristotle's account of the relation between perception and thought compares with contemporary versions of concept empiricism.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">When I have the time, I like to garden. I used to work as a gardener <a href="http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html#gardens" target="_blank">here</a>, and I'm keen on growing vegetables using the no-dig method. If you want to know about no-dig gardening, you should read <a href="http://www.nyrb.com/products/the-one-straw-revolution?variant=1094932353" target="_blank">this wonderful book</a>, (or <a href="http://www.charlesdowding.co.uk/product/organic-gardening-the-natural-no-dig-way/" target="_blank">this one</a> for advice more appropriate to the British climate).</p>
