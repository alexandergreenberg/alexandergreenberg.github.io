    <p class="paragraph">I am a researcher in philosophy and law.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I'm currently a Lecturer in the Law at the University of Surrey. I've previously held positions at Southampton, UCL, Birkbeck, Oxford, Cambridge, and Gothenburg.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">My current research mainly looks at the philosophical and theoretical justiciation for legal rules for determining criminal responsibility. I'm particularly interested in the psychological concepts that figure in criminal law doctrines – concepts like awareness, knowledge, belief, and intent – and the interrelation between legal discussions of these concepts and philosophical discussions in epistemology and philosophy of mind and action. For 2019-22, I carried out a Leverhulme Trust-funded project at UCL, <em>Belief in Philosophy and the Criminal Law</em>. This project looked at the role of belief in the criminal law and how this could be informed – and also inform – philosophical accounts of belief.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I've published on a variety of topics in both philosophy and law journals (see <a href="/publications/">here</a> for my publications). I've written about the justifiability of criminalizing negligence and blaming for culpable ignorance, on the signficance of the recklessness/negligence distinction, and on legal standards of proof. Before I became interested in the intersection of philosophy and criminal law, I mainly worked in epistemology and philosophy of mind, and my work in that area primarily looks at how we should understand the responsibility we have over what we believe, and the norms determining what we should believe and what we should say. I also have a side-interest in Aristotle's philosophy of mind.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I studied for my PhD in the Philosophy Department at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of <a href="http://www.timcrane.com" target="_blank">Tim Crane</a> and <a href="http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/ahmed/ahmed-page" target="_blank">Arif Ahmed</a>.</p>
