    <p class="paragraph">I am a research associate and project manager on the <a href="http://www.newdirectionsproject.com" target="_blank">New Directions in the Study of the Mind</a> project, based in in the <a href="http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk" target="_blank">Faculty of Philosophy</a> at the University of Cambridge. I'm also currently finishing my PhD, also in the Cambridge Philosophy Faculty. Before that, I completed an MPhil in Philosophy at Cambridge, and a BA in Philosophy and Ancient Greek at University College London.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">My research centres on psychological, epistemological, and normative questions about belief, and how these questions interrelate. These questions include:</p>
    <ul class="questions-list">
      <li>What distinguishes believing from other attitudes like imagining, supposing, or guessing?</li>
      <li>How do we have knowledge of our own beliefs? Is it through conscious awareness, inference, or some other means?</li>
      <li>What makes a belief justified, rational, or knowledge?</li>
      <li>What kind of norms govern belief? How are they different from (or similar to) practical and moral norms governing action?</li>
      <li>In what sense, if any, do we count as responsible for our beliefs? Does this responsibility require direct voluntary control over our beliefs?</li>
    </ul>
  <p class="paragraph">My PhD thesis is on epistemic normativity. In particular, it argues that belief is subject to a truth norm that prescribes that one ought to believe something if and only if it's true. I argue for this on the grounds that belief being subject to such a norm can give a unifying explanation of epistemic justification. My supervisors are <a href="http://www.timcrane.com" target="_blank">Tim Crane</a> and <a href="http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/ahmed/ahmed-page" target="_blank">Arif Ahmed</a>.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">When I have the time, I like to garden. I used to work as a gardener <a href="http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html#gardens" target="_blank">here</a>, and I'm keen on growing vegetables using the no-dig method. If you want to know about no-dig gardening, you should read <a href="http://www.nyrb.com/products/the-one-straw-revolution?variant=1094932353" target="_blank">this wonderful book</a>, (or <a href="http://www.charlesdowding.co.uk/product/organic-gardening-the-natural-no-dig-way/" target="_blank">this one</a> for advice more appropriate to the British climate).</p>
