    <p class="paragraph">I am a philosopher. I work on the intersection of epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I'm currently a Stipendiary Lecturer in Philosophy at <a href="http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk">Lady Margaret Hall</a>, Oxford, and (for the summer of 2018) a Visiting Fellow on the <a href="https://representationandreality.gu.se" target="_blank">Representation and Reality</a> project at the University of Gothenburg. Previously, I was a Lecturer at <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/philosophy/">Birkbeck, University of London</a>, and worked on the <a href="http://www.newdirectionsproject.com" target="_blank">New Directions in the Study of the Mind</a> project at the University of Cambridge, where I also studied for my PhD.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">My research centres on psychological, epistemological, and normative questions about belief, such as:</p>
      <ul class="questions-list">
        <li>What distinguishes believing from other attitudes like imagining, hoping, or intending?</li>
        <li>What makes a belief justified, rational, or knowledge?</li>
        <li>What kind of norms govern that govern belief? How are they different from (or similar to) practical and moral norms governing action?</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">My <a href="/phd-thesis/">PhD thesis</a> was on epistemic normativity. In particular, it argued that belief is subject to a truth norm that prescribes that one ought to believe something if and only if it's true. I argue for this on the grounds that belief being subject to such a norm can give a unifying explanation of epistemic justification. My supervisors were <a href="http://www.timcrane.com" target="_blank">Tim Crane</a> and <a href="http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/ahmed/ahmed-page" target="_blank">Arif Ahmed</a>.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Currently, I am working on a variety of issues in philosophy of epistemology, moral psychology, and the history of philosophy of mind. These include:
      <ul class="questions-list">
        <li>Thinking about whether there are distinctively epistemic norms on speech acts like assertion.</li>
        <li>Investigating how to unify the varieties of responsibility we have for our actions and attitudes. In doing this, I've recently become interested how lawyers and legal theorists think about the legal categories of <em>mens rea</em> (intention, foreknowledge, recklessness, negligence).</li>
        <li>For my work on the Representation and Reality project, looking at how Aristotle's account of the relation between perception and thought compares with contemporary empirically-informed versions of concept empiricism.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">When I have the time, I like to garden. I used to work as a gardener <a href="http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html#gardens" target="_blank">here</a>, and I'm keen on growing vegetables using the no-dig method. If you want to know about no-dig gardening, you should read <a href="http://www.nyrb.com/products/the-one-straw-revolution?variant=1094932353" target="_blank">this wonderful book</a>, (or <a href="http://www.charlesdowding.co.uk/product/organic-gardening-the-natural-no-dig-way/" target="_blank">this one</a> for advice more appropriate to the British climate).</p>
