    <p class="paragraph">I am a PhD student in Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. Before my PhD, I studied for an MPhil in Philosophy at Cambridge, and a BA in Philosophy and Ancient Greek at University College London.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">My research centres on psychological, epistemological, and normative questions about belief, and how these questions interrelate. These questions include:</p>
    <ul class="questions-list">
      <li>What distinguishes believing from other attitudes like imagining, supposing, or guessing?</li>
      <li>How do we have knowledge of our own beliefs? Is it through conscious awareness, inference, or some other means?</li>
      <li>What makes a belief justified, rational, or knowledge?</li>
      <li>What kind of norms govern belief? How do they differ from (or similar to) practical and moral norms governing action?</li>
      <li>In what sense, if any, do we count as responsible for our beliefs? Does this responsibility require direct voluntary control over our beliefs?</li>
    </ul>
  <p class="paragraph">My PhD thesis is on epistemic normativity. In particular, it argues that belief is subject to a truth norm that prescribes that one ought to believe something if and only if it's true. I argue for this on the grounds that belief being subject to such a norm can give a unifying explanation of epistemic justification.

  <p class="paragraph">When I have the time, I like to garden. I used to work as a gardener <a = href="http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html#gardens" target="_blank">here</a>, and I try to grow vegetables on my allotment using the no-dig method. If you want to know about no-dig gardening, you should read <a href="http://www.nyrb.com/products/the-one-straw-revolution?variant=1094932353" target="_blank">this wonderful book</a>, (or <a href="http://www.charlesdowding.co.uk/product/organic-gardening-the-natural-no-dig-way/" target="_blank">this one</a> for advice more appropriate to the British climate).</p>
