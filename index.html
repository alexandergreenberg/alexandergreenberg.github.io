    <p class="paragraph">I am a researcher in philosophy and law.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I'm currently a Senior Teaching Fellow in Philosophy at the University of Southampton, and a Lecturer in Law at Balliol College, Oxford. I've previously held positions at UCL, Birkbeck, Oxford, Cambridge, and Gothenburg.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I work in both philosophy and law, in particular criminal law. My current research mainly looks at how legal rules for determining criminal responsibility can be informed by – and also inform – philosophical discussions. I'm particularly interested in the psychological concepts that figure in criminal law doctrines – concepts like awareness, knowledge, belief, intent – and can be better understood by drawing on philosophical discussions of these concepts in epistemology and philosophy of mind and action.      My current research is about what we can learn about psychological concepts (such as belief, knowledge, awareness, intention, and emotion) by looking at the role these concepts play in the criminal law (e.g. in relation to negligence, consent, complicity, and self-defence). For 2019-22, I carried out a Leverhulme Trust-funded project at UCL, <em>Belief in Philosophy and the Criminal Law</em>. This project focused on how a defendant's beliefs – or their failure to have the correct beliefs – matters to their criminal responsibility, and investigates both how the role of belief in the criminal law can inform our philosophical accounts of belief, and how philosophical work on belief can help us better understand the criminal law.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I've published on a variety of topics in both philosophy and law journals (see <a href="/publications/">here</a> for my publications). I've written about the justifiability of criminalizing negligence and blaming for culpable ignorance, on the signficance of the recklessness/negligence distinction, and on legal standards of proof. Before I became interested in the intersection of philosophy and criminal law, I mainly worked in epistemology and philosophy of mind, and my work in that area primarily looks at how we should understand the responsibility we have over what we believe and the norms determining what we should belief (as well as a side-interest in Aristotle's philosophy of mind).</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I studied for my PhD in the Philosophy Department at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of <a href="http://www.timcrane.com" target="_blank">Tim Crane</a> and <a href="http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/ahmed/ahmed-page" target="_blank">Arif Ahmed</a>. In my <a href="/phd-thesis/">PhD thesis</a>, and in <a href="/publications/">subsequent papers</a>, I argued that belief is subject to a truth norm that prescribes that one ought to believe something if and only if it's true. It argued for this on the grounds that belief being subject to such a norm can give a unifying explanation of epistemic justification.</p>
